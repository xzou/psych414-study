    <p><em>Literary Analysis and Taste <br/>
    Psychology Department -- College of William and Mary</em></p>
    <p>This study aims to examine the processes of literary analysis and interpretation as they relate to taste. You will be presented with ten excerpts written by authors from different time periods. For each passage, you will be asked to carefully read it before writing a brief, open-ended analysis. Upon completion of each analysis, you will be asked to rate (1) the objective quality of the passage and (2) your subjective liking of the passage. In the interest of preserving the integrity of this study, please refrain from screenshotting, photographing, copying, or writing down the contents of these passages.</p>
