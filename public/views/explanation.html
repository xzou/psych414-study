    <h3>Debriefing</h3>
    <p>Thank you once again for taking the time to participate in this study. As you might know, it is sometimes necessary
    to use deception in social psychology research in order to elicit the most natural responses. Unfortunately, we had to use deception
    in this experiment because of the nature of what we were trying to measure. However, we undertook considerable effort in ensuring the ambiguity of this study, so please don't feel badly that you may have been deceived.</p>
    <p>The real purpose was to study how much criticsâ€™ opinions and peer consensus influence our subjective evaluations of literary works. Overall, we were interested in measuring how you rated each excerpt, and how much you liked it. The analyses you provided will not be measured, but they were used to get you to engage with the work and to maintain the pretense that the study was about literary analysis. The experiment actually consisted of four conditions, and all of the excerpts shown to participants were written by either Allen Ginsberg, the poet, or Justin Bieber, the pop singer. Depending on which condition you were in, the labels ("By a prominent 20th century poet" or "By a popular 21st century young pop star") were either congruent or incongruent with the actual author of the excerpt. We were essentially interested in seeing the effect of label, i.e. whether people would like the works labeled as by the poet more than the works labeled as by the pop star, regardless of who actually wrote the work. </p>
    <p>Please know that no part of this experiment was meant to measure your abilities or personality in any way. In fact, looking at just individual data points would tell us nothing. Instead, we are interested in averages across a large number of participants. It is therefore important that you not divulge anything about your experience to anyone who might take place in this study, as you can probably see from this debriefing how any prior knowledge or expectations will render the data useless.</p>
